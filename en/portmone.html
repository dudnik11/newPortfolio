                    <h3>Object Oriented Design</h3>
                    <p>We used Object Oriented Design to quickly understand the new product, what objects exist in it, and how they are related to each other. The interface of personal account was divided into objects with their properties, data types, corner
                        cases, and methods.</p>
                    <p>It turned out that many entities in the system were duplicated: they performed the same actions with the same data. There were about 20 objects in the product, the number of which was reduced by half. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="picture ">
                    <img src="../img/portmone/portmone2.png ">
                </div>
                <div class="text_block ">
                    <h3>Menu reorganization</h3>
                    <p>We started with navigation. In the right menu, there were Accounts and balances, Balances in companies, Invoice archives, Templates, Automatic payments, Other payments, and Reports. All of them belong to the same class Account because
                        they perform the same actions with the same data. For example, Templates and Automatic payments are the same Invoices, but the actions in them are partially or completely performed by the system, not by a person. The Accounts archive
                        is simply a display of the list of Accounts. However, all this has been divided into different menu items with different displays. </p>
                    <p>Using the same approach, we have identified the classes Service, User, Payment Method, etc.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="picture ">
                    <img src="../img/portmone/portmone3.gif ">
                </div>
                <p>As a result, we ended up with only 4 menu items that corresponded to our classes:</p>

                <div class="text_block ">
                    <h3>Concept</h3>
                    <p>In the Portmone flow, a person basically defines who to pay, where to pay from, and how much to pay. This is the minimum necessary information, so you can start with it.</p>
                    <p>In our concept, a person enters <b class="bold">to whom,</b> and the system will determine what it is and add the necessary fields. If you enter a number, it offers to top it up or whatever is assigned to that number, and if you enter
                        an address, it offers to pay the utility bill or whatever else is at that address.</p>
                    <p>Thanks to the object model, we know that Portmone has this data and can use it. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="picture ">
                    <img src="../img/portmone/portmone5.png ">
                </div>
                <div class="text_block ">
                    <h3>From OOP to design system</h3>
                    <p>The object model describes the blocks of the system, and now we need to visualize them. We have collected components, including their properties, use cases, methods, and various states.</p>
                    <p>The bottom line is that we first create components that will be reused frequently in design and development. This approach has advantages for many roles:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b class="bold ">For designers.</b> You don't need to come up with a new design every time and draw it from scratch, you can assemble a design from existing blocks and modify the old ones.</li>
                        <li><b class="bold ">For developers.</b> No need to write the entire code every time, you can ctrl-c and ctrl-v. Cleaner code and faster development.</li>
                        <li><b class="bold ">For users.</b> Consistent design, in which identical objects look and work in the same way.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <div class="text_block ">
                    <h3>Operational testing</h3>
                    <p>Even though the design was done in Figma, we wanted to test a prototype as close to reality as possible. For efficiency, we created real inputs and transitions on top of the images in Axure.</p>
                    <p>We tested with operational testing: we recorded the time to complete a task, dividing it into checkpoints. This way, we realized where people spend the most time. We went through several iterations. </p>
                    <p>At this stage, we simplified the design even further: we left only one field, and everything else is shown later.</p>
                    <p><b class="bold ">In the final version, everything starts with a single question: what do I need to pay?</b></p>

                <div class="text_block ">
                    <p>We have accomplished 3 tasks:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>reorganized the navigation, reduced the number of items and combined them into 4 sections;</li>
                        <li>unified the way information is displayed within sections, set rules for the interface, and created blocks that can be reused and assembled into new ones;</li>
                        <li>provided easier access to 1500+ services that can be paid for via Portmone.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We also changed the main page of the site so that new users could quickly achieve their goals and register, and the solution was comprehensive and complete.</p>
                    <p>Now the user reaches the desired goals more than 2 times faster, and Portmone has a scalable interface that adapts and looks consistent across different devices.</p>
