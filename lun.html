                    <p>The Comfort Map is a map that visualizes the results of research that helps people understand where to live comfortably in Kyiv.</p>

                    <h3>Interviews</h3>
                    <p>To help people choose a comfortable place for living, we need to understand how they do it now and what they consider as comfortable. To do this, we conducted qualitative research, including in-depth interviews and testing of the existing
                        solution. We translated the audio recordings into text and identified <b>the pains, gains, and tasks </b> that people set for themselves. This was the result of the research phase.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="picture ">
                    <img src="../img/lun/lun2.png ">
                    <h5>The artifacts were divided into 8 categories</h5>

                <div class="text_block ">
                    <h3>Jobs to be done</h3>
                    <p>Next, we had to turn the results of the interviews into an artifact that would help preserve and share the gained knowledge, as well as work with it further. The results of our interviews did not fit into a single scenario, there were
                        many of them and they touched different areas of life. That's why we used Jobs to be Done.</p>
                    <p>Based on the pains, gains, and tasks we received, we generated 31 job stories. This is also a lot, so we selected 9 of them using a two-factor analysis. Each job story was rated from 0 to 10 based on two parameters: how well the need
                        is met and how important it is to people. We selected the jobs with the most optimal ratio and generated solutions for them.</p>

                    <h3>Testing</h3>
                    <p>All the ideas were collected into one clickable prototype and tested on users. To do this, we came up with several testing scenarios. The prototype went through several iterations. The final version included the following solutions.</p>

                <div class="text_block ">
                    <h3>A character and on<mark class="lun ">bird</mark>ing</h3>
                    <p>While testing the existing solution, we saw that it was difficult for users to navigate a large number of filters and it was unclear what information they displayed and how the map worked in general. To solve this, we added the bird
                        Ficha, an existing character in LUN. It will accompany the user on the map and help them explore the districts of Kyiv. To do this, we drew Ficha in different situations.</p>

                    <h3>Where in Kyiv is the best to...</h3>
                    <p>We found out that people don't want to switch different filters as much as they want to find out a specific answer to a question <b class="bold ">"Where is best place to...?".</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>During the study, we identified 3 criteria or 3 types of activity that are important to people: <b class="bold ">living, resting and traveling.</b> All the filters were divided into these three categories, reducing the workload on
                        the user and speaking the same language with them.
                    </p>
                    <p>Sharing is one of the indicators of project success. That's why we added a separate button for this.</p>

                    <p>One of the most important criteria when choosing a place to live is how long it takes to get to and from work, how far is it to the store, is there a coffee shop nearby. We tried to make it possible to find the answers on the map:
                        You can select a point and see how long it takes to get to other places.</p>

                    <h3>Engagement</h3>
                    <p>In the future, users can be involved in filling out the map and making them "partners" in improving Kyiv. For example, they can enter data about neighborhoods they visit or care about.</p>
                    <p>For this, they can receive points, increasing their rating among other concerned residents of Kyiv: for example, "New to the City", "Local", "Not Indifferent", and the highest level is â€œKyivLover".</p>
                    <p>Those who have reached the highest level can be given LUN merchandise, which will help spread the idea of the project and draw attention to the care for the city we live in.</p>
